`Dev Containers` is an extension lets you use a container as a full-featured development environment. You can go to any folder of the container you want to interact, change and code.

The Dev Containers extension supports two primary operating models:

In your workspace folder will have a file named `devcontainer.json`. It show how to access the development container.

You can open any running docker and then use the `terminal` instead of `EXE` in docker.
